hygienotronics
==============

A simple robotic system that monitors and reminds / encourages toilet users to wash hands after visiting / using a toilet. 

DETAILS
=========

**Theme**: Sanitation Hackathon
**Date**: December 16 2012
**Location**: Smile communications, Bukoto

**Project**: Higyienotronics

**Problem**:
  Forgeting to wash hands after visting Toilet

**Details**: 
	It is a recommended habbit that any visit to a toilet be accompanied with washing hands.
        This simple habbit alone has been shown to boost sanitary health.

**Proposition**:
	Building a system to encourage hand washing offenders to change their minds and wash
        hands after visiting, say a toilet.
        We intend to achieve this by implimenting a mechanism to monitor hand washing after
        Toilet visit. System reminds would-be offenders to actually go on and was hands.

**Tools**:
	We are exploiting image processing and machine vision algorithms running on android.
	Also, we exploit inter-connected device-networks for device collaboration and 
	making use of the Arduino micro-controller for integrated monitoring and extra feedback

**Assumptions**:
	Each Toilet/Latrine has a hand-washing facility
